## Today's talk

* Why might you care
* What is big data doing anyway?
* Thoughts from Chicago
* Implications for evaluation work
* Implications for evaluator skills

## Why might you care

* A new type of evaluand
* New insight as background knowledge
* New data for old evaluands
* A whole new skillset

# What is big data 

## Some unsatisfactory definitions

> - "Data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate."
> - "Velocity, volume, variety"
> - "The convergence of enterprise and consumer IT"
> - "The new tools helping us find relevant data and analyze its implications."
> - "A new attitude ... that combining data from multiple sources could lead to better decisions."

## My definition (today)

*Digital traces of everyday activity, collected and stored at much finer resolution and higher frequency than pre 2000*

> - wearable devices like fitbits
> - individual financial transactions
> - mouse events
> - motion sensors
> - CCTV
> - GPS tracking in phones and cars
> - smart electricity meters

## Different types

# Thoughts from a Chicago roundtable

## Opportunities

> - Build counterfactuals when not previously possible?
> - Whole new sources of data?
> - Use predictive capabilities to plan quasi-experiments
> - Provide clues to what needs further examination by other methods

## Reservations expressed

> - Populations we work with often don't leave a digital trail
> - Satellite imagery good for environmental work, but what is the social equivalent?
> - Do evaluators have the skills?
> - New analytical methods better at prediction than explaining causality...

## Michael Bamberger's 'high applicability' set (1) {data-transition="fade-out"}

> - Large, complex interventions
> - Conventional evaluation designs methodologically weak
> - Easy, physical measurement
> - Indicators have construct validity

## Michael Bamberger's 'high applicability' set (2) {data-transition="fade-in"}

> - Long duration
> - Continue to operate beyond proof of concept so can test against prediction
> - Large number of potential variables and no clear theoretical way through
> - No political concerns about data ownership, privacy etc



# So what might it mean in New Zealand...

## New evaluands

* Government and even NGO programs will increasingly be based on data-intensive analytics (eg social investment approach)
* Private sector is embracing this area fast, although New Zealand has a way to go
* When the evaluand is a big-data intervention, you'll need to construct a big data quasi experiment to be credible

## New sources of insight outside the evaluand

* Official statistics will increasingly be based on admin data including big data
* Big data will change the background level of knowledge in many areas of social science
* Other countries' social and economic sectors will build much more profound understanding of what works

## New methods

* Interventions that don't think of themselves as "big data" will increasingly generate it as a side product
* We won't have the luxury of insisting on exactly the right indicator, but will have to get (very) good at separating the signal from the noise with proxies
* We have to get on top of the accidental opportunities arising from the routine storage of sensor, administrative, and other information
